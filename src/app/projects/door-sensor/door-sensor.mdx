# Door Sensor Final Report

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In Spring 2025, our final project for Engineering 11 was to design and prototype a practical 
engineering product. After brainstorming and evaluating multiple ideas, we decided to create a door sensor. 
The purpose of this device is to detect the opening of a door using a magnetic switch and to alert the user with a sound via a mini piezo buzzer. 
This simple, compact, and effective system enhances home security and accessibility, especially for individuals needing sound-based alerts.

## 2.0 Design Problem Formulation

### 2.1 Filling a Niche
While many commercial door sensors exist, many are expensive, bulky, or require Wi-Fi and smartphone integration. 
Our goal was to build a low-cost, battery-powered, stand-alone door sensor with audible feedback, suitable for dorms, homes, or tool sheds.

### 2.2 Market Surveying
We explored multiple concepts before settling on our final design:

- **Tracking Bracelet**: A sensor placed near the entrance would detect if the wearer crossed the threshold and trigger an alarm. Price ~$50.
- **Ring Camera System**: Would notify users on their smartphones whenever someone exited. Price ~$80.
- **RFID System**: Detects tags as they pass through. Price ~$60–$100.

### 2.3 Performance Requirements
- Cost under $200  
- Fit within 1.5×1×1 cm housing  
- Audible buzzer when door opens  
- Run on a small battery for 3–6 months  
- Indoor use (32°F–104°F)  

### 2.4 Customer Satisfaction Curves
User satisfaction was mapped vs. runtime, price, and power consumption.

## 3.0 Project Engineering

### 3.1 Work Scope
- 6 weeks development  
- Weekly meetings, Discord + Drive for collaboration  
- Deliverables: prototype, CAD sketches, test report, BOM, final report  

### 3.2 Team Roles
- **Ryan Huynh**: Circuit design, CAD modeling, writing/editing  
- **Adrian Vinuya**: Assembly, soldering, BOM  
- **Arielah Arana**: Prototyping, 3D printing, cost estimation  

## 4.0 Conceptual Design

- **Concept 1 – Wearable Safe Space Alarm**  
- **Concept 2 – Ring Camera System**  
- **Concept 3 – Final Design: Reed Switch + Piezo Buzzer** ✅

## 5.0 Configuration Design

- **Transmitter Housing**: Reed switch, buzzer, battery  
- **Magnet Housing**: Mounted on door  

When door opens, magnet moves away, switch closes, buzzer activates.

## 6.0 Parametric Design

### 6.1 Design for Assembly
- Minimal part count  
- Snap-fit housing  
- Coin cell battery holder  
- Easy maintenance  

### 6.2 Design for Function
- Durable plastic housing  
- Low power consumption (~6 months CR2032)  
- Loud (~85 dB) buzzer  
- Safe 3V operation  

## 7.0 Engineering Analysis

### 7.1 Power & Battery Life
- Piezo ~15 mA when active  
- ~20 door openings/day, 2 sec each  
- Avg draw ~0.057 mA → Battery life 5–6 months  

### 7.2 Response Time
- Reed switch: <1 ms  
- Alert delay: <10 ms  

### 7.3 Sound Output
- ~85 dB at 1 meter  

### 7.4 Range & Alignment
- Reliable within 10 mm  
- Neodymium magnet preferred  

## 8.0 Testing

- **Test 1**: Circuit works, buzzer triggers instantly  
- **Test 2**: Reed switch range ~10 mm  
- **Test 3**: Sound level ~85 dB  
- **Test 4**: Battery ~5–6 months  

## 8.5 Conclusion & Recommendations
- Meets goals: compact, reliable, cost-effective  
- Future improvements: add wireless alerts, weatherproofing, PCB design, LED/buzzer customization

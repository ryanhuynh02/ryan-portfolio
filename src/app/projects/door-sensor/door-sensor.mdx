## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In Spring 2025, our final project for Engineering 11 was to design and prototype a practical engineering product. After brainstorming and evaluating multiple ideas, we decided to create a door sensor. The purpose of this device is to detect the opening of a door using a magnetic switch and to alert the user with a sound via a mini piezo buzzer. This simple, compact, and effective system enhances home security and accessibility, especially for individuals needing sound-based alerts.

## 2.0 Design Problem Formulation

### 2.1 Filling a Niche
While many commercial door sensors exist, many are expensive, bulky, or require Wi-Fi and smartphone integration. Our goal was to build a low-cost, battery-powered, stand-alone door sensor with audible feedback, suitable for dorms, homes, or tool sheds.

### 2.2 Market Surveying

We explored multiple concepts before settling on our final design. Below are our initial and alternative ideas:

<div className="not-prose grid gap-8">

  {/* Concept 1 — Tracking Bracelet */}

    />
    <div className="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
      <h4 className="font-bold">1. Tracking Bracelet:</h4>
      <p>
        A sensor placed near the entrance detects if the wearer crosses the threshold
        and triggers an alarm, alerting caretakers. This idea was appealing but
        limited in scenarios with many people in a room.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Price Estimate:</strong> $50</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Concept 2 — Ring-style Camera */}

    <div className="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
      <h4 className="font-bold">2. Ring-style Camera Monitoring:</h4>
      <p>
        A camera near the door monitors activity and sends alerts to a smartphone.
        Provides strong monitoring but is costly and requires internet connectivity.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Price Estimate:</strong> $80</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Concept 3 — RFID System */}

    />
    <div className="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
      <h4 className="font-bold">3. RFID-based System:</h4>
      <p>
        RFID tags and a reader at the door detect passage of tracked individuals or
        objects. Effective but more expensive and requires tag management.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Price Estimate:</strong> $60–$100</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</div>


### 2.3 Performance Requirements
- Cost under $200  
- Fit within **1.5 × 1 × 1 cm** housing  
- Sound a piezo buzzer when the door opens  
- Run on a small battery **~3–6 months**  
- Indoor use (32°F–104°F / 0°C–40°C); keep dry; avoid direct sun/moisture

### 2.4 Customer Satisfaction Curves

To evaluate user satisfaction, we developed a set of curves illustrating how customer
satisfaction varies with different performance factors. These include runtime (before
battery change), price, and power consumption. Our goal was to ensure that our design
choices align with the expectations and preferences of potential users.

</ul>

<br />
The team collaborated closely to ensure all deadlines were met, with flexibility built into the schedule to allow for iterative improvements and troubleshooting.

## 4.0 Conceptual Design

<br />
In the conceptual design phase, our team explored and evaluated multiple possible solutions before selecting the final approach. Each concept offered distinct advantages and trade-offs, which were compared using a weighted rating matrix.

### 4.1 Design Concept Alternatives

**Concept 1 — Wearable Safe-Space Alarm** 

<br />
A system using trackers worn by individuals. If a tracked person exits through the door, the receiver triggers an alarm to alert caregivers.  

<br />
- **Pros:** Provides monitoring for vulnerable users (e.g., elderly or children).  
- **Cons:** Requires every user to wear a device; higher cost and complexity.

<br />
**Concept 2 — Ring-style Camera Monitoring**  

<br />
A camera mounted near the entrance detects movement and sends notifications to a smartphone app.  

<br />
- **Pros:** Remote monitoring, integrates with smart devices.  
- **Cons:** Expensive, requires Wi-Fi and app setup, higher maintenance.

<br />
**Concept 3 — Final Design (Chosen)**✅  

<br />
A simple reed switch paired with a piezo buzzer and coin-cell battery. When the door opens, the magnet separates from the reed switch, closing the circuit and activating the buzzer.  

<br />
- **Pros:** Low cost, simple construction, reliable, energy efficient.  
- **Cons:** Provides only local alerts, requires proper magnet alignment.

### 4.2 Weighted Rating Matrix

The concepts were evaluated against key criteria such as **cost**, **reliability**, **simplicity**, and **power consumption**. The reed-switch design achieved the highest score, making it the preferred solution.

## 5.0 Configuration Design

### 5.1 Layout Sketch
The door sensor consists of two housings:

<br />
<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
  <li>
    <strong>Transmitter Housing:</strong> Attached to the door frame, containing the reed switch, battery, piezo buzzer, and wiring.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Magnet Housing:</strong> A small enclosure mounted on the door, aligned with the reed switch to maintain a closed circuit while the door is shut.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
When the door opens, the magnet moves away from the reed switch, causing it to close the circuit and activate the buzzer. The device operates independently without requiring Wi-Fi or an external power source.

## 7.0 Engineering Analysis

### 7.1 Power Consumption and Battery Life

The door sensor is powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery (3V, ~220 mAh). The circuit consists of a reed switch (passive), a mini piezo buzzer, and minimal wiring. Most of the time, the device draws virtually no current due to the open reed switch. Current only flows when the door is opened and the circuit is triggered.

<br />
**Assumptions:**
<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Reed switch: passive (0 mA)</li>
  <li>Piezo buzzer: draws ~15 mA when active</li>
  <li>Buzz duration: ~2 seconds per activation</li>
  <li>Door opens ~20 times per day</li>
</ul>

<figure className="not-prose my-6 flex flex-col items-center">
  <img
    src="/projects/door-sensor/assets/image23.jpg"
    alt="Power consumption calculation — average daily current draw estimated"
    className="rounded-lg w-full max-w-2xl"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-2 text-center">
    Power consumption calculation — average daily current draw estimated.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Add estimated idle leakage current: ~0.05 mA
**Total average current draw** ≈ 0.057 mA
**Estimated Battery Life:** ~5 to 6 months

### 7.2 Response Time

The reed switch closes almost instantaneously (~1 ms) when the magnet moves away. The piezo buzzer activates immediately upon switch closure. This ensures the alert is triggered as soon as the door opens, providing near real-time feedback.

<br />
**Conclusion:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Switch Response Time: &lt;1 ms</li>
  <li>Audible Alert Delay: &lt;10 ms</li>
  <li>System responsiveness is excellent for the intended use</li>
</ul>

### 7.3 Sound Output

The mini piezo buzzer emits sound in the range of 80–90 dB, sufficient to alert someone in a small room or hallway. This level was chosen to be noticeable but not irritating.

### 7.4 Range & Alignment

The magnetic reed switch activates when the magnet is within approximately 10 mm. Careful alignment of the sensor housing and magnet enclosure ensures consistent triggering.

<br />
**Key Notes:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Misalignment beyond 10 mm may prevent activation</li>
  <li>Neodymium magnets are preferred for stronger fields</li>
</ul>

## 8.0 Testing

### 8.1 Test 1 – Circuit Functionality

**Objective:**  
Verify that the reed switch properly triggers the piezo buzzer when the magnetic field is disrupted.

<br />
**Clarification:**  
The reed switch used in our circuit has three wires: one input wire, and two output wires (a short leg and a long leg).  
- The **short leg** corresponds to a normally closed (NC) contact.  
- The **long leg** corresponds to a normally open (NO) contact.  

Since we want the mini piezo buzzer to activate when no magnet is detected (i.e., when the door is open), we connect the **long leg (NO contact)** to the piezo buzzer. This ensures that when the magnet is present, the circuit is open and the buzzer is off. When the magnet moves away, the circuit closes through the NO contact, allowing current to flow and the buzzer to sound.

<br />
**Procedure:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Connected the reed switch, piezo buzzer, and CR2032 battery on a breadboard</li>
  <li>Aligned a neodymium magnet with the reed switch</li>
  <li>Moved the magnet away to simulate a door opening</li>
</ul>

<br />
**Result:**  
The buzzer activated immediately upon moving the magnet, confirming that the reed switch triggered correctly. The circuit returned to idle when the magnet was brought back. The response time was **under 10 ms**.

### 8.2 Test 2 – Magnetic Range

**Objective:**  
Determine the maximum distance at which the reed switch responds to the magnet.

<br />
**Procedure:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Incrementally increased the distance between the magnet and the reed switch</li>
  <li>Recorded the maximum gap at which the circuit still activated the buzzer</li>
</ul>

<figure className="not-prose my-6 flex flex-col items-center">
  <img
    src="/projects/door-sensor/assets/image4.png"
    alt="Reed switch trigger response vs. magnet distance — the switch activates reliably up to ~10 mm"
    className="rounded-lg w-full max-w-2xl"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-2 text-center">
    Reed switch trigger response vs. magnet distance — the switch activates reliably up to ~10 mm.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Result:**  
The reed switch consistently activated the buzzer when the magnet was within approximately **10 mm**. Beyond this distance, the circuit failed to trigger reliably.

### 8.3 Test 3 – Sound Audibility

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the loudness of the buzzer in a typical indoor environment.

<br />
**Procedure:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Activated the buzzer in a quiet room</li>
  <li>Used a sound level meter to measure the decibel output at 1 meter</li>
</ul>

<figure className="not-prose my-6 flex flex-col items-center">
  <img
    src="/projects/door-sensor/assets/image2.png"
    alt="Mini piezo buzzer sound vs. distance — sound level"
    className="rounded-lg w-full max-w-2xl"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-2 text-center">
    Mini piezo buzzer sound vs. distance — sound level.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Result:**  
The buzzer produced a sound level of approximately **85 dB at 1 meter**, which is comparable to the loudness of city traffic and sufficient to alert users in a household environment.

### 8.4 Test 4 – Battery Life

**Objective:**  
Estimate battery longevity under realistic usage conditions.

<br />
**Assumptions:**

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>20 door openings per day</li>
  <li>2-second buzzer activation per event</li>
  <li>0.057 mA average current draw (as calculated in Section 7)</li>
</ul>

<figure className="not-prose my-6 flex flex-col items-center">
  <img
    src="/projects/door-sensor/assets/image3.jpg"
    alt="Estimated battery life vs. door opens per day — battery longevity"
    className="rounded-lg w-full max-w-2xl"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-2 text-center">
    Estimated battery life vs. door opens per day — battery longevity.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Result:**  
Based on the assumptions, the CR2032 coin cell battery is expected to last approximately **180 days (6 months)** under typical use. Increased door activity shortens battery life, while fewer daily activations extend it.

### 8.5 Conclusion and Recommendations

**Conclusion**

<br />
Through iterative prototyping and testing, our team successfully developed a compact, low-cost, and energy-efficient door sensor. The device performs reliably using a magnetic reed switch and piezo buzzer to alert users when a door is opened. Key test results demonstrated:

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Immediate response (<10 ms) upon magnetic disruption</li>
  <li>Audible buzzer output around 85 dB, effective for indoor alerts</li>
  <li>Reliable activation within a 10 mm magnet range</li>
  <li>Projected battery life of approximately 5–6 months using a CR2032 coin cell</li>
</ul>

<br />
The overall system met its core performance goals and user-centered design criteria, including ease of use, modular construction, and minimal maintenance.

<br />
**Recommendations** 

<br />
For future improvement and scaling, we recommend:

<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
  <li><strong>Adding Wireless Capabilities</strong> – Integrating a low-power wireless module (e.g., BLE or LoRa) could enable remote notifications to smartphones or smart home hubs.</li>
  <li><strong>Weatherproofing the Housing</strong> – Sealing the housing with gaskets or silicone would allow for outdoor or semi-outdoor use.</li>
  <li><strong>PCB Integration</strong> – Replacing hand-wiring with a printed circuit board (PCB) would improve durability, consistency, and ease of assembly.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface Enhancement</strong> – Incorporating an LED indicator or adjustable buzzer tone could improve user interaction and accessibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular Battery Design</strong> – Designing for AA or rechargeable battery packs could provide longer life or environmental benefits.</li>
</ul>

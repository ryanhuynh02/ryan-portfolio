# Door Sensor — Final Report (Extracted)


<!-- Page 1 -->

DOOR SENSOR FINAL REPORT 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background 
In Spring 2025, our final project for Engineering 11 was to design and prototype a practical 
engineering product. After brainstorming and evaluating multiple ideas, we decided to 
create a door sensor. The purpose of this device is to detect the opening of a door using a 
magnetic switch and to alert the user with a sound via a mini piezo buzzer. This simple, 
compact, and effective system enhances home security and accessibility, especially for 
individuals needing sound-based alerts. 
2.0 DESIGN PROBLEM FORMULATION 
 
2.1 Filling a Niche 
While many commercial door sensors exist, many are expensive, bulky, or require Wi-Fi and 
smartphone integration. Our goal was to build a low-cost, battery-powered, stand-alone 
door sensor with audible feedback, suitable for dorms, homes, or tool sheds. 
 
2.2 Market Surveying 
We explored multiple concepts before settling on our final design. Below are our initial and 
alternative ideas: 
 
1.


<!-- Page 2 -->

**Tracking Bracelet**:  A sensor placed 
near the entrance would detect if the 
wearer crossed the threshold and trigger 
an alarm, alerting caretakers. This idea 
was appealing but limited to the quantity 
if there are too many people in a room. 
Price Estimate: $50 
 
 
2.  
 
**Ring Camera System**: It would 
notify users on their smartphones 
whenever someone exited a predefined 
boundary. While functional and 
modern, it required a Wi-Fi module, 
mobile app integration, and a 
camera—all of which were costly and 
time-consuming. 
Price Estimate: $80 
 
 
 
3.


<!-- Page 3 -->

**RFID**: RFID (Radio Frequency 
Identification) systems are commonly used 
in retail and library environments to detect 
tagged items as they pass through a sensor 
gate. In our context, a similar system could 
be used to detect when a person or pet 
(wearing an RFID tag) exits a space. The 
system uses passive or active RFID tags and 
a reader module near the door, but it 
becomes expensive when scaling up 
 
 
 Price Estimate: $60–$100 for a basic RFID reader and tag set 
  
 
 
2.3 Performance Requirements 
 
Function and Performance: 
- Must cost under $200 to build 
- Must fit within a 1.5x1x1 cm housing 
- Must sound piezo buzzer when the door is opened 
- Must run on a small battery (e.g., coin cell or AA) 
- Must work for over 3 months without battery replacement 
 
Operating Environment: 
This device is designed for indoor residential use. It should operate within a temperature 
range of 32°F to 104°F (0°C to 40°C). It is not waterproof and must be kept dry. It should be 
mounted on a door frame away from direct sunlight or moisture. 
 
Life Expectancy: 
The device is expected to last over 2 years with normal use. The reed switch and piezo 
buzzer have no moving parts and are rated for tens of thousands of cycles. Battery life will 
depend on usage and power-saving techniques but is estimated at 3–6 months before 
replacement.


<!-- Page 4 -->

Repair, Disposal, and Maintenance: 
This is a low-cost device intended for minimal maintenance. The battery should be replaced 
when depleted. If the device malfunctions, basic repairs like replacing the reed switch or 
piezo buzzer may be possible if soldering tools are available. Otherwise, the unit can be 
recycled or disposed of in accordance with electronic waste regulations. The plastic housing 
should be recycled if possible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4 Customer Satisfaction Curves 
 
To evaluate user satisfaction, we developed a set of curves illustrating how customer 
satisfaction varies with different performance factors. These include runtime (before 
battery change), price, and power consumption. Our goal was to ensure that our design 
choices align with the expectations and preferences of potential users.

3.0 Project Engineering 
 
3.1 Work Scope 
 
The development of the door sensor project was completed over the course of 6 weeks. The 
scope of work included idea generation, component research, prototyping, testing, and 
documentation. A Gantt chart was used to plan and track progress throughout the phases of 
the project (see Appendix A). Team meetings were held weekly to share updates, 
troubleshoot issues, and assign tasks. Communication was maintained through group 
messaging and shared documents on Discord and Drive. 
The final deliverables included: 
● A working prototype of the door sensor 
 
● CAD sketches of the housing 
 
● A performance test report 
 
● A finalized bill of materials

4.0 Conceptual Design 
 
4.1 Design Concept Alternatives 
During the early stages of brainstorming, our team considered multiple designs to address 
the goal of detecting when a person or pet leaves a defined safe space. Below are the 
concepts we explored: 
Concept 1 – Safe Space Alarm with Wearables


<!-- Page 8 -->

This concept involved using wearable trackers (bracelets or collars) for individuals or pets. 
A sensor placed near a doorway would detect when the wearer exited and trigger a central 
alarm. 
  
Pros: 
● Continuous monitoring 
 
● Works for multiple users 
 Cons: 
 
● Costly due to multiple devices 
 
● Complex pairing and communication 
 
● Requires power-hungry wireless modules 
 
Concept 2 – Ring-Style Camera Monitoring System 
 
This idea involved using a camera and software to detect motion or exits, then send 
smartphone notifications. 
 
 Pros: 
● Visual confirmation 
 
● Remote alert system 
 Cons: 
 
● Requires internet connection 
 
● Complex setup and privacy concerns 
 
● Expensive (camera, Wi-Fi, app)


<!-- Page 9 -->

Concept 3 – Final Design: Door Sensor with Reed Switch and Piezo Buzzer 
 
The final concept is a cost-effective and simplified solution. It consists of a magnetic reed 
switch, a piezo buzzer, and a CR2032 battery. When the door opens and the magnetic 
contact is broken, the reed switch closes the circuit, triggering the buzzer. 
  
Pros: 
● Very low cost 
 
● Simple to build and reliable 
 
● Low power consumption 
 Cons: 
● No remote alert (local only) 
 
● One-directional detection (door opens only) 
 
 
4.2 Weighted Rating Matrix 
We evaluated each concept using a weighted matrix to determine the most appropriate 
solution based on our key criteria:


<!-- Page 10 -->

Based on the results of this matrix, we chose the reed switch door sensor design for its 
superior cost-efficiency, simplicity, and ease of implementation. 
 
 
 
5.0 Configuration Design 
 
5.1 Layout Sketch 
The door sensor consists of two housings: 
● Transmitter Housing: Attached to the door frame, containing the reed switch, 
battery, piezo buzzer, and wiring. 
 
● Magnet Housing: A small enclosure mounted on the door, aligned with the reed 
switch to maintain a closed circuit while the door is shut. 
 
When the door opens, the magnet moves away from the reed switch, causing it to close the 
circuit and activate the buzzer. The device operates independently without requiring Wi-Fi 
or an external power source.

6.2 CAD & Assembly Drawing 
 
Door Sensor Housing


<!-- Page 15 -->

There are two cutouts in the housing design. The rectangular hole is for the on/off switch, 
allowing users to easily enable or disable the alarm system. The circular hole is positioned 
to align with the mini piezo buzzer, allowing the sound to pass clearly through the enclosure 
for effective audio alerts. 
Additionally, there is a slot at the top designed for a sliding lid. This feature allows users to 
open the housing conveniently to replace the battery, perform maintenance, or upgrade 
components. It also supports easier disassembly for recycling at the end of the device’s life 
cycle. 
Inside the main housing, we securely place the reed switch, battery holder, and power 
switch, then solder the connections to complete the circuit.


<!-- Page 16 -->

Sliding cover


<!-- Page 17 -->

This is the sliding lid for the main housing. We designed a chambered cutout to provide 
users with a convenient grip area, making it easy to slide the lid open or closed. Additionally, 
the rails were precisely cut and fitted to ensure the lid aligns securely with the housing, 
forming a tight seal that helps prevent water and dirt from entering and damaging the 
internal components. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Magnet Housing


<!-- Page 18 -->

This is the magnet holder, designed to be mounted on the door frame, positioned close to 
the main housing. The main housing, which contains the electronics, is mounted on the 
moving part of the door. When the door is closed, the magnet aligns with the reed switch in 
the main housing to maintain the circuit’s inactive state. Opening the door causes the 
magnet to move away, triggering the alarm.


<!-- Page 19 -->

Magnet cover


<!-- Page 20 -->

The magnet cover serves to protect the magnet from physical damage and environmental 
exposure while also providing a clean, aesthetically pleasing appearance. 
 
 
7.0 Engineering Analysis 
 
 
7.1 Power Consumption and Battery Life 
The door sensor is powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery (3V, ~220 mAh). The circuit 
consists of a reed switch (passive), a mini piezo buzzer, and minimal wiring. Most of the 
time, the device draws virtually no current due to the open reed switch. Current only flows 
when the door is opened and the circuit is triggered. 
Assumptions:


<!-- Page 21 -->

● Reed switch: passive (0 mA) 
 
● Piezo buzzer: draws ~15 mA when active 
 
● Buzz duration: ~2 seconds per activation 
 
● Door opens ~20 times per day 
 
 
 
Add estimated idle leakage current: ~0.05 mA 
 Total average current draw ≈ 0.057 mA 
 
 Estimated Battery Life: ~5 to 6 months 
 
7.2 Response Time 
The reed switch closes almost instantaneously (~1 ms) when the magnet moves away. The 
piezo buzzer activates immediately upon switch closure. This ensures the alert is triggered 
as soon as the door opens, with near real-time feedback. 
Conclusion: 
● Switch Response Time: <1 ms 
 
● Audible Alert Delay: <10 ms 
 
● System responsiveness is excellent for the intended use. 
 
 
7.3 Sound Output


<!-- Page 22 -->

The mini piezo buzzer emits sound in the range of 80–90 dB, sufficient to alert someone in a 
small room or hallway. This level was chosen to be noticeable but not irritating. 
 
7.4 Range and Alignment 
The magnetic reed switch activates when the magnet is within approximately 10 mm. 
Careful alignment of the sensor housing and magnet enclosure ensures consistent 
triggering. 
Key Notes: 
● Misalignment beyond 10 mm may prevent activation. 
 
● Neodymium magnets are preferred for stronger fields. 
 
8.0 Engineering Analysis 
 
8.1 Test 1 - Circuit Functionality 
Objective: Verify that the reed switch properly triggers the piezo buzzer when the magnetic 
field is disrupted. 
Clarification: The reed switch used in our circuit has three wires: one input wire, and two 
output wires (a short leg and a long leg). The short leg corresponds to a normally closed 
(NC) contact, while the long leg is the normally open (NO) contact. 
Since we want the mini piezo buzzer to activate when no magnet is detected (i.e., when the 
door is open), we connect the long leg (NO contact) to the piezo buzzer. This ensures that 
when the magnet is present, the circuit is open and the buzzer is off. When the magnet 
moves away, the circuit closes through the NO contact, allowing current to flow and the 
buzzer to sound. 
 
Procedure: 
 
● Connected the reed switch, piezo buzzer, and CR2032 battery on a breadboard.


<!-- Page 23 -->

● Aligned a neodymium magnet with the reed switch. 
 
● Moved the magnet away to simulate a door opening. 
 
Result: 
 The buzzer activated immediately upon moving the magnet, confirming that the reed switch 
triggered correctly. The circuit returned to idle when the magnet was brought back. The 
response time was under 10 ms. 
 
8.2 Test 2 - Alignment Sensitivity 
Objective: Determine the maximum distance at which the reed switch responds to the 
magnet. 
Procedure: 
● Incrementally increased the distance between the magnet and the reed switch. 
 
● Recorded the maximum gap at which the circuit still activated the buzzer. 
 
 
Result: 
 The reed switch consistently triggered at a distance up to ~10 mm. Beyond that, activation 
became unreliable. Alignment is critical for consistent functionality.


<!-- Page 24 -->

8.3 Test 3 - Sound Audibility 
Objective: Evaluate the loudness of the buzzer in a typical indoor environment. 
Procedure: 
● Activated the buzzer in a quiet room. 
 
● Used a sound level meter to measure the decibel output at 1 meter. 
 
 
 
Result: 
 The buzzer produced ~85 dB, sufficient to alert someone in the same room or adjacent 
hallway. 
 
8.4 Test 4 - Battery Life 
Objective: Estimate battery longevity under realistic usage conditions. 
Assumptions:


<!-- Page 25 -->

● 20 door openings per day 
 
● 2-second buzzer activation per event 
 
● 0.057 mA average current draw (as calculated in Section 7) 
 
 
Result: 
 Theoretical runtime is ~5–6 months per CR2032 battery. A long-duration real-world test is 
in progress to verify this projection. 
 
 
8.5 Conclusion and Recommendations 
Conclusion 
Through iterative prototyping and testing, our team successfully developed a compact, 
low-cost, and energy-efficient door sensor. The device performs reliably using a magnetic 
reed switch and piezo buzzer to alert users when a door is opened. Key test results 
demonstrated: 
● Immediate response (<10 ms) upon magnetic disruption


<!-- Page 26 -->

● Audible buzzer output around 85 dB, effective for indoor alerts 
 
● Reliable activation within a 10 mm magnet range 
 
● Projected battery life of approximately 5–6 months using a CR2032 coin cell 
 
The overall system met its core performance goals and user-centered design criteria, 
including ease of use, modular construction, and minimal maintenance. 
Recommendations 
For future improvement and scaling, we recommend: 
1. Adding Wireless Capabilities 
 Integrating a low-power wireless module (e.g., BLE or LoRa) could enable remote 
notifications to smartphones or smart home hubs. 
 
2. Weatherproofing the Housing 
 Sealing the housing with gaskets or silicone would allow for outdoor or 
semi-outdoor use. 
 
3. PCB Integration 
 Replacing hand-wiring with a printed circuit board (PCB) would improve durability, 
consistency, and ease of assembly. 
 
4. User Interface Enhancement 
 Incorporating an LED indicator or adjustable buzzer tone could improve user 
interaction and accessibility. 
 
5. Modular Battery Design 
 Designing for AA or rechargeable battery packs could provide longer life or 
environmental benefits.
